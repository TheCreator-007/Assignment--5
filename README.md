# Assignment-5 Shoe Store (Redux + Payment Demo)

This project is a React + Redux application that demonstrates state management with **Redux Toolkit**, a shopping cart system, search functionality, and a simulated payment flow. Users can browse shoes, add items to the cart, view and modify the cart, and proceed to a credit-card payment page — all in a responsive, user-friendly UI.
